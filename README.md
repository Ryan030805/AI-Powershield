🛡️ AI-PowerShield
==================

AI-PowerShield is a multi-layer phishing detection and online safety platform that analyzes suspicious messages, links, and attachments using a hybrid AI + security-analysis engine.

Instead of relying on a single classifier, the system combines transformer-based language understanding with infrastructure inspection and behavioral analysis to produce interpretable security decisions and a unified risk score.

⚠️ Required Model Download (Important)
======================================

This repository does not include the trained AI models because they exceed GitHub’s file size limits.

You must download them once before running the project.

Setup Instructions
==================

- Download both zip files.
- Extract them.
- Inside the project directory, create the folders:
        nlp/phishing-model/
        nlp/prompt_model/

- Move the extracted files into their respective folders.

Your final structure must be:

nlp/
├── phishing-model/
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── tokenizer.json
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   ├── special_tokens_map.json
│   └── model.safetensors
│
├── prompt_model/
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── tokenizer.json
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   ├── special_tokens_map.json
│   └── model.safetensors
